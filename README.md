# basic-REDIS-setup-Node-Js-
This is a very basic setup. I use REDIS 3.1.2 version because version 4 doesn't work with the current Node version 16.14.2

Redis is a database that is mostly used for caching data for a faster performance. Instead of sending a bunch of requests we are using cached version spending way less time on the requests.
